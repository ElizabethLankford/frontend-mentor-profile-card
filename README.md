## Overview

This was a Frontend Mentor challange to style a profile card component.

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided
  The design provided was static JPG images. I used best judgement for sizing, margin, and padding. I also strived to make the design responsive on both mobile and desktop devices.

## My process

Mobile-first approach
I first focused on a smaller screen size and used relative units for the sizing elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

For this project I focused on the mobile first approach. I found it to be easier to create a layout with a mobile device in mind and then worry about the resizing if viewed on a larger device.
